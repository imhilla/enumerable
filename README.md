## Enumerable Methods

In this project, i got a chance to dive deeper into Ruby methods. Previously, i learned about the Enumerable module which gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods.

First i created a script file to house my custom methods and ran it in IRB to test them.
Added my new methods onto the existing Enumerable module. Ruby makes this easy because any class or module can be added to without trouble ... just do something like:

module Enumerable
    def my_each
      # your code here
    end
  end

Created #my_each, a method that is identical to #each.

Created #my_each_with_index in the same way.

Created #my_select in the same way

Created #my_all?

Created #my_any?

Created #my_none?

Created #my_count

Created #my_map

Created #my_inject


Lastly, i added examples to show that the methods works same us the inbuilt methods Ruby offers.

## How to set up in local machine

Enumerables are easier to setup. You can use Sourcetree, Git from the command line, or any client you like to clone your Git repository. These instructions show you how to clone your repository using Git from the terminal.
First, from the repository, click + in the global sidebar and select Clone this repository under Get to work.
Secondly, Copy the clone command (either the SSH format or the HTTPS).
If you are using the SSH protocol, ensure your public key is in github and loaded on the local system to which you are cloning.
Forth, From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.
Paste the command you copied from Github.

If the clone was successful, a new sub-directory appears on your local drive in the directory where you cloned your repository. This directory has the same name as the github repository that you cloned. The clone contains the files and metadata that Git requires to maintain the changes you make to the source files. At that point you will be ready to view enumerable files and install them locally.
